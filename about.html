                        <h2>Our Story </h2>
						<p>
                        Founded in September 2006 Life of Victory Church had a humble but blessed beginning meeting at a local hotel conference room. 
						However God placed a clear vision in the heart of senior pastor Roman Horbachevskyy and through much prayer and obedience God 
						has given the church resources, growth, and ability to impact the city of Auburn. <br>
						 <br>
						Originally Pastor Roman is from Lviv Ukraine and together with his wife and two children he moved to Kent WA in 2003. 
						Right away after his arrival, he knew that he was not going to settle into comfortable Christian living, but rather 
						decided to eagerly seek God and fight for the lost souls. <br> <br>
						
						As a church we believe that God has called us to first, worship and exalt His name in our services and our everyday lives. 
						Second he has called us to serve and love each other through support, encouragement and fellowship of his people. And third 
						Jesus gave his followers a commission to spread the gospel of good news to the lost that salvation can be found in Jesus Christ. <br> <br>
						
						Currently our church has many active ministries including Missions, Home Groups, Mosaic Sisterhood, Victory Kids, Impact Collective (Youth),<!-- Revival Ministry to help battle 
						addictions, Drama, --> and Humanitarian Ministry. <br> <br>
						
						We thank you for visiting our page and welcome to visit us in person if you have that ability, you will find that we are a friendly bunch.

                        1. The Scriptures are Inspired by God and declare His design and plan for mankind. <br>
						2. There is only One True God–revealed in three persons…Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (commonly known as the Trinity). <br>
						3. In the Deity of the Lord Jesus Christ. As God’s son Jesus was both human and divine. <br>
						4. Though originally good, Man Willingly Fell to Sin–ushering evil and death, both physical and spiritual, into the world. <br>
						5. Every Person Can Have Restored Fellowship with God Through ‘Salvation’ (accepting Christ’s offer of forgiveness for sin). [1 of 4 cardinal doctrines of the A/G] <br>
						6. Practice two ordinances—(1) Water Baptism by Immersion after repenting of one’s sins and receiving Christ’s gift of salvation, 
						and Holy Communion (the Lord’s Supper) as a symbolic remembrance of Christ’s suffering and death for our salvation. <br>
						7. The Baptism in the Holy Spirit is a Special Experience Following Salvation that empowers believers for witnessing and effective service, just as it did in New Testament times. <br>
						8. The Initial Physical Evidence of the Baptism in the Holy Spirit is ‘Speaking in Tongues,’ as experienced on the Day of Pentecost and referenced throughout Acts and the Epistles. <br>
						9. Sanctification Initially Occurs at Salvation and is not only a declaration that a believer is holy, but also a progressive lifelong process of separating from evil as believers 
						continually draw closer to God and become more Christlike. <br>
						10. The Church has a Mission to seek and save all who are lost in sin. We believe ‘the Church’ is the Body of Christ and consists of the people who, throughout time, have accepted 
						God’s offer of redemption (regardless of religious denomination) through the sacrificial death of His son Jesus Christ. <br>
						11. A Divinely Called and Scriptural Ordained Leadership Ministry Serves the Church. The Bible teaches that each of us under leadership must commit ourselves to reach others for 
						Christ, to worship Him with other believers, and to build up or edify the body of believers–the Church. <br>
						12. Divine Healing of the Sick is a Privilege for Christians Today and is provided for in Christ’s atonement (His sacrificial death on the cross for our sins). <br>
						13. The Blessed Hope—When Jesus Raptures His Church Prior to His Return to Earth (the second coming). At this future moment in time all believers who have died will rise from their 
						graves and will meet the Lord in the air, and Christians who are alive will be caught up with them, to be with the Lord forever. <br>
						14. The Millennial Reign of Christ when Jesus returns with His saints at His second coming and begins His benevolent rule over earth for 1,000 years. At that time many in the nation 
						of Israel will recognize and accept Him as the Messiah, the Savior who died for them and all mankind. <br>
						15. A Final Judgment Will Take Place for those who have rejected Christ. They will be judged for their sin and consigned to eternal punishment in a punishing lake of fire. <br>
						16. Look forward to the perfect New Heavens and a New Earth that Christ is preparing for all people, of all time, who have accepted Him. We will live and dwell with Him there forever 
						following His millennial reign on Earth. ‘And so shall we forever be with the Lord!
